# CodeAstro_project
This repsitory stands for the CodeAstro project.

The idea would be to create a new python package wich facilitates the task of ploting whatever kind of plot (lines, scatter, images, histograms, etc) when coding. Today, the user must to import several libraries depending on which plot she/he is interested for. The aim of this project is to correct this dependance with a lot of libraries and make a global and easy library which englobes the entire variety of possibilities. 

The structure od that package is structured in classes, where each class  represents one kind of plot. By now, we consider the following types:

- Line plots
- Scatter plots
- Images
- Histograms
