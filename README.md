# CodeAstro_project
This repository stands for the CodeAstro project.

The idea would be to create a new python package which facilitates the task of plotting whatever kind of plot (lines, scatter, images, histograms, etc.) when coding. Today, the user must import several libraries depending on which plot she/he is interested for. The aim of this project is to avoid this dependance with a lot of libraries and make a global and easy library which encompasses the entire variety of possibilities. 

This package is structured in classes, where each class represents one kind of plot. By now, we consider the following types:

- Line plots
- Scatter plots
- Images
- Histograms
